# Routine: Update Aggregator Wrappers

This is a manual routine for updating the Python wrapper scripts used to run knowledge aggregation profiles.

**When to use:**
Trigger this routine when you need to change the standard logic for how profiles are executed (e.g., changing how errors are handled, adding new logging, etc.).

**Steps:**
1.  **Update Template in README:** Modify the Python wrapper template located in the `README.md` under the "Tip: Create a Python Wrapper Script" section.
    - Reference: `[README.md](mdc:README.md)`
2.  **Update Existing Wrappers:** Go to the `WRAPPERS/` directory and manually update all existing `*.py` wrapper scripts to reflect the changes made to the template.
    - Reference: `[WRAPPERS/](mdc:WRAPPERS/)`
3.  **Verify:** Run one of the updated wrappers to ensure the new logic works as expected.
