# GitWorkflow

This project uses the GitWorkflow system as defined in https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/GitWorkflow/README.md.

## Branch Structure

- `main` - The primary branch that contains production-ready code
- `develop` - The development branch where features are integrated
- `feature/*` - Feature branches for new functionality
- `fix/*` - Branches for bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes that need to be applied directly to main

## Workflow Rules

1. Always create feature branches from `develop`
2. Use descriptive branch names with prefixes (`feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`)
3. Rebase feature branches before merging to maintain a clean history
4. Use `--no-ff` when merging to preserve feature branch history
5. Delete branches after they are merged

Follow all GitWorkflow procedures for this repository.
