# Global Rule: Always Test After Editing

❗❗❗❗❗❗ **CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE** ❗❗❗❗❗❗

After making **any** code modification, the following verification loop **must** be executed:

1.  **Run the Script:** Execute the primary script or a relevant test case (e.g., a wrapper script) to validate the changes.
2.  **Verify the Output:**
    -   Check the terminal output for any errors or unexpected messages.
    -   Inspect the generated files (e.g., in `knowledge_base_output/`) to confirm they match the expected outcome. This includes checking filenames, content, and that files are not empty unless expected.
3.  **Iterate Until Success:**
    -   If the run fails or the output is incorrect, **do not stop**.
    -   Analyze the failure, propose a fix, and apply it.
    -   Return to Step 1 and repeat the loop until the script runs successfully and the output is confirmed to be correct.

This iterative "run, verify, fix" cycle is mandatory to ensure the project remains in a working state.
