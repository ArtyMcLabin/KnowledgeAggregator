# Project Rule: Profile Credential Management

❗❗❗❗❗❗ **CRITICAL RULE** ❗❗❗❗❗❗

This project intentionally stores service-specific credentials (e.g., for a specific Supabase instance) **directly inside the JSON profile files** located in `[projectsSources/](mdc:projectsSources/)`.

-   **DO NOT** move credentials from a project's `.json` profile to the `.env` file.
-   **DO NOT** modify the script to read these credentials from `.env`. The design is for profiles to be self-contained.
-   The `.env` file should **ONLY** be used for user-specific, global API keys that are not tied to a single project, such as a developer's personal `TRELLO_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN`.

This design allows different projects (`wa_assistant`, `gr-site`, etc.) to use completely separate credentials for the same service (e.g., two different Supabase databases) without conflict. Always preserve this structure.
