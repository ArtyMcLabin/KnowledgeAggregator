# System Dependency Installation

For this project, system-level dependencies (like database command-line tools) that are not available through `pip` should be installed using the Chocolatey package manager.

This ensures the environment can be set up programmatically.

**Example:**
To install PostgreSQL client tools, the following command should be used:
`choco install postgresql -y`
